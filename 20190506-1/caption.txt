As expected, free-space-optical turns to the bar.  The "swiss
embassy", where "forces" collide.

Of course, there should be no such thing.  But, here we are.  Facing
the law in actuality.  Conceptions positive and negative.  Conceptions
transparent and conceptions opaque.

We are witness to the temporal coincidence of heightened degrees of
messaging.  Political credibility is asserted and feigned to the
fortunes of person and proxy.

The issue of the future of the seemingly superfluous and malignant
Department of Homeland Security may be seen rising from the guise of
public awareness of the normalization of avarice.

The aggression, sources, and vectors evident are disturbing.  The
apparent context of "prison culture" is coincident with other forms of
disease of violence.

For some, the appearance of dark opacity becomes a veil over
awareness.  The aversion to actuality a learned habituation to
intimidation.  For others, the dark opacity is a grotesque malevolence
in the case of law enforcement.  Unimaginable, but born of witness
heinous and horrible.

We see such behavior in some overgrown children having issues with
violence.  We require law enforcement to contradict violence as in
cooperation with psychology.

The witness of violent induction on behalf of law enforcement is
bizarre and inexplicable.  We tie these threads together by
consistency of reports from the field, and supported by confirmation
from officials in government where the conflict over the rule of law
is in full bloom.
