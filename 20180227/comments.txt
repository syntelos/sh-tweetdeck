Prerequisite: complex environment

Prerequisite: well known hijacking game
Prerequisite: national defense optical politics
Prerequisite: integrity of free space optics

Comments:

The first opinion is that this is not to be understood as more than an
elementary step in a game of confidence and credibility.  In this
view, the observer has elected to grant the "intel" column the
appearance of a constructive (vaguely related or integrated) sequence
of optical "signals".

Theory:

In terms of game theory, we may imagine that this conclusion is in the
interest of all parties.  

/GT/ The antogonist wishes to deflate the observation of antagonism,
and the protagonist wishes to inflate the observation of
protagonism. /GT/

Conjecture:

The association of cabinet level actors and their teams with
incredulity annd constitutional antagony is maintained.

The association of the FBI with the role of a constitutional
protagonist is maintained.
